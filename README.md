# C Code README

## Description

This C code is a multi-functional program that performs arithmetic operations, gathers user information, and calculates the areas and perimeters of geometric shapes. It includes operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the calculation of areas for squares and circles.

## Features

- Arithmetic Operations: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers.
- User Information: Collects user information such as name and age.
- Geometry Calculations: Computes the area of a square, the area of a circle, and the perimeter of a rectangle.
- Cube Calculation: Finds the cube of a given number.

## Usage

1. **Arithmetic Operations:**
   - Enter two numbers when prompted to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **User Information:**
   - The program will greet the user by name and ask for their age.

3. **Geometry Calculations:**
   - For the area of a square, enter the side length when prompted.
   - For the area of a circle, enter the radius when prompted.
   - For the perimeter of a rectangle, enter the length and width when prompted.

4. **Cube Calculation:**
   - Enter a number when prompted to find its cube.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the C code file.
3. Compile the code using the appropriate compiler command (e.g., `gcc filename.c -o program`).
4. Run the compiled program (e.g., `./program`).
